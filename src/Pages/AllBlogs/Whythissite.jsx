          As I was freshening up on React, I was looking at doing some projects
          that would help me refresh on React, which I wanted to do as I am
          going to the 4th and final semester, which has advanced web
          development as a major course. So, I decided on making a log site
          where I could just jot down my thoughts, save up my learning, and also
          save some reusable components or material that I make for future
          reference. So, this site is going to be all that.
