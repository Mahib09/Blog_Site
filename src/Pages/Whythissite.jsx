        <p>
          As, I was Freshneing up on react, I was looking on doing some projects
          that would help me refresh on react which i wanted to do as I am going
          to the 4th and final semester which has advanced web development as a
          major course. So, I decided on making a log site where i can just jot
          dowbn my thoughts, save up my learnings and also save some reusable
          components or material that i make for future refrence. So, This site
          is going to be all that.
